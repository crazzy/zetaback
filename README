Prerequisites
=============
 * A backup host with sufficient disk space.
 * SSH in place where a user on the backup server can perform a password-less
   remote login to the clients (using ssh keys) and execute the agent script 
   as root.
 * Perl 5 on client and server.
 * ZFS tools installed.

Installation
============
cp Makefile.in Makefile
make
make install

By default, the install prefix is /usr/local, and perl is expected to be
/usr/bin/perl.  Edit Makefile to change.  You should also make sure that you 
have the 'pod2man' utility in your path.
