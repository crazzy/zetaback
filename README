Prerequisites
=============
 * A backup host with sufficient disk space.
 * SSH in place where a user on the backup server can perform a password-less
   remote login to the clients (using ssh keys) and execute the agent script 
   as root.
 * Perl 5 on client and server.
 * ZFS tools installed.

Installation
============
Edit Makefile to taste for install prefix (defaults to /usr/local).
If you want to use a particular Perl binary instead of the typical
/usr/bin/perl, you can set that too.  

If you just want to use the defaults, a 'make && make install' will configure 
and install everything.
